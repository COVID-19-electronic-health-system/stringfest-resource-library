# What statistical test should I use?

<!---
I like to compare variable types to like different ingredients and based on those ingredients you can do different things.

There’s so much interest in machine learning now but don’t overlook statistics! You will see that many of these are also used in machine learning as well.

Remember also that many of these could rely on other assumptions etc.
